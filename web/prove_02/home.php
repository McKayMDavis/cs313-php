				Sitting has been part of humanity since before humans were humans--just look at apes, they sit. These days, we might sit on a couch, chair, or something else raised. In ages past, we would have likely just sat on the ground, tree stumps, or rocks. In a way, every time you are outdoors and sit on a log or rock, you are gaining a deeper connection to our ancient predecessors. Think back on a time when you have sat. Did it feel nostalgic? Now you know why.
